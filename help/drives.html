<h1>Drives</h1>

<p>In the Drives tab, you need to set the drives that are connected to the computer as active.</p>

<p>From the list you select the drive then click Add.<br>
The new added drive will be included in the table, and you can set for it your Own Label to easily identify it.</p>
<p>To edit a field, you have to use the form and to save the new data. You must press Save Changes else the changes will not be saved to database.</p>

<p>If you connect a new drive to your computer, the app will be notified and automatically add the new drive to the drive list. This will be the last one on the list. If you want to index it, it must be added to the table!</p>
<p>If you disconnect a drive added to the table, it will be marked in the Active column with a red X and removed from the drive list. Indexed folders belonging to this drive will no longer be visible in the Folder tab until the drive is reconnected, but indexed files will obviously be available for searching.</p>
<p>If you remove a drive from the table (do this only if you will not reuse that drive), the indexed files will remain available for search. If you want to remove them, you must delete the indexed folders belonging to that drive before disconnecting the drive from the computer.</p>
