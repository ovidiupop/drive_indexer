<p>If you unplug one drive added to the table, that will be marked in the Active column with a red X and will be removed from the list of drives.  The indexed folders belonging to this drive will not be visible anymore in the Folder tab until the drive will be re-connected. The indexed files will obviously be available for search.</p>

<p>If you remove a drive from the table (do this only if you will not reuse that drive), the indexed files will remain available for search. If you wish to remove them, you have to delete indexed folders which belong to that drive.</p>
