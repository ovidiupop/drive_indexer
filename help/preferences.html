<h1>Preferences</h1>

<p>Here you can set some preferences</p>

<p>
<ul><li>Add header to exported csv</li></ul>
If is checked, in exported csv will be added the header of each column.</p>
<br>
<p>
<ul><li>File information is modal</li></ul>
If is checked, when you double-clicked on a row from search results, you will be able to open only a single file at a time. This will prevent to have a lot of small windows opened which will need then to be closed.<br>
But if you need to compare more files, you can uncheck this option.</p>
