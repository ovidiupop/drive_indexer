# Drive Indexer

Index your entire drive collection in one place and find anything in a second!

If you are like me and have a big collection of old drives where you keep all your history, documents, work, pictures, favorite music and movies, then you never know exactly where to find them when you needs.
That's why Drive Indexer was created. Now, you can find anything in a second!
How it works?

- Mount your drive in your computer or using an externally USB adapter or a docking station. And yes, you can index also Flash drives!
The application will identify your newly added drive when it will be connected to computer.
- In the Drives tab, you have to add each indexable drive. Select it from list and push the Add button.
- Add your desired folders (or the entire drive) in the Folders tab. When you add the folder, the indexer will automatically start to scan your drive and index its files. In the Preferences tab you can set to manually start the indexing.

Important! If the folder to be scanned is very large or if the drive is idle, will take few moments before it starts! Don't worry!

- You have to index each drive of your collection.
  Application is set to index by default only the files with most usual extensions, grouped by categories. But also you can add any other extension as you prefer. Or you can set to index anything in the Preferences tab!
  Even if you will have same folders structure on more drives, the application will identify them individual. In this way you will know always the right place where your files are.

- You will search for the term which identify your files. The results are displayed in the Search Results Table. Here you can sort them in the way you like.
  The details of each file is easily to see, some of them having also a preview. Just double-click on the line!

- If you wish to export the results in a csv file, you have two options:
    - Export all the results
    - Export only selected results

- After you have finished indexing, you have the possibility to check for duplicates that take up unnecessary space and export the result in a CSV file.

That's all!
Happy searching!
