1. Issue: Using drive adaptor mounted in a path, will make impossible to make differences between more drives. Any drive
   will be identified as the first mounted one, because its path (ex:/home/matricks/aacustom/MySerials) and because
   the serial number of drive is the same for all drives (ex:  4990779F50C0), being actually the one set by adapter.
   Solution:
   Use drive label to identify indexed drives. In the folders database, aside serial will save also the label.
   When mount a new drive, changing the label will become mandatory before indexing any folder.
       How to check for valid drive: Label must be different by name
   To correct identify the drive will use composed key serial & label (not only serial,
        because adapter will set the same serial for each mounted drive)
   Why label and not name?
        You can have more drives from same type. If will be mounted with the same adapter, will be no difference!
